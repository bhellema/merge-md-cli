# Columns
This block is used to present content side by side in multiple columns, providing a more structured, visually balanced layout.

## Implementation
This blockâ€™s table has multiple columns and rows, with the first row containing only the block name and optional variants.

In the second row, create as many columns (cells) as needed for your layout.
Each cell can contain text, images, or other elements.
As a rule, blocks must not be nested in other blocks.
Additional rows may be added below, and must contain the same number of columns as the second row.
When rendered, CSS and JavaScript will transform each cell into a column, displaying them in a responsive grid.

## When to use

When you need to compare or present related content side by side.
To organize lengthy copy or various media elements into a more digestible layout.
When a balanced, multi-column arrangement supports better readability.
When to consider another block

If you only need one column or a single piece of content.
When each content piece requires its own distinct styling beyond simple columns.
If a vertical layout or stacked design is more appropriate for your page structure.
