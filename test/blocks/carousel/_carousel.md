# Carousel
This block is used to display multiple images or slides in a rotating or swipable format, allowing users to navigate through a series of visual elements with optional text content.

## Implementation
This block’s table has 2 columns and multiple rows, with the first row containing only the block name and optional variants.

Each subsequent row represents a single slide and can include:

Image (mandatory) - in the first cell of the row, with no other content.
Text content (optional) - in the second cell of the row. This cell can contain:
Title (optional) – styled as a Heading.
Description or Additional Content (optional)
Call-to-Action (optional) – linked text at the bottom of the cell.
When rendered, CSS and JavaScript transform each row into a slide, providing navigation controls (e.g., arrows or dots) for users to move between them.

## When to use

When you have multiple featured images or content pieces you want to showcase in a limited space.
To present a dynamic gallery or promotional highlights.
When you want to encourage user interaction by clicking or swiping through slides.
When to consider another block

If you only have one piece of featured content, making rotation unnecessary.
When all content should remain visible without user interaction or scrolling.
If performance or mobile constraints make slides less user-friendly.
