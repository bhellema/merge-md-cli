# Cards
This block is used to showcase distinct pieces of information in a consistent, card-based layout, each card typically containing an image, a title, and descriptive text.

## Implementation
This block’s table has 2 columns and multiple rows, with the first row containing only the block name and optional variants in parenthesis.

Each subsequent row represents a single card and can include:

Image or Icon (mandatory) - in the first cell of the row.
Text content (mandatory) - in the second cell of the row. This cell can contain:
Title (optional) – styled as a Heading.
Description (optional) - below the heading.
Call-to-Action (optional) - linked text at the bottom of the cell.
When rendered, CSS and JavaScript transform each row into a card, arranging them in a grid or list layout based on available space.

## When to use

To highlight multiple related features, products, or articles.
When you want a uniform visual style for items with distinct content.
To make a set of clickable, structured elements that are easy to scan.
When to consider another block

If you need just a single feature or highlight, rather than multiple cards.
When your layout requires more complex components or varied styling per item.
If a simpler list or table layout better fits the content.
If no images are present in the cards, consider the ‘no images’ variant
